# Virtualization-OperatingSystems

This documentation is not code-intensive, but it more so shows my learning process and what I did
as well as how others who want to learn can replicate. 

I will touch on checking the desired OS images, verifying the image integrity, allocating storage
and/or partitioning storage for the image, and how to boot into a Virtual Machine vs. BIOS.

Additionally, I will also discuss what I struggled with, provide alternatives/solutions, and 
insights I picked up from my mistakes. I also aim to make the process a lot simpler so that upcoming
learners can pick these things up quicker.
